title: Welcome to TinYard

TinYard is an IoC-container written in C# for .NET that brings more features than just a bog-standard IoC-container.

TinYard aims to improve your code by providing an easy-to-use IoC container and more through its powerful but simple extensibility.

### Features

The primary features of TinYard:

#### IoC-Container

TinYard, first and foremost, is an IoC-Container that wants to make your life easy via Dependency Injection (DI).

#### Modularity

Modularity is a key component of TinYard. Thanks to the way TinYard was built, it's super easy to expand on the base framework and add lots of great `extensions` within it.

#### MVC Framework

TinYard doubles as an MVC Framework - if you desire it!

You'll find that TinYard comes bundled with a few `extension`s, and `bundle`s, 
a big one of these being the `MVC Bundle` that converts TinYard from being just an
IoC-container into a whole MVC Framework.
